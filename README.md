# SimpleScope

A very basic CSV-based match analyzer.

## Usage
- Run ``npm run serve``.
- Visit the URL given by the command.
- Upload your CSV file, and explore!

The program currently expects a square robot of a fixed size, but that can be easily adjusted, along with everything else on the page.

Minimum expected keys:
- time
- Match State (DISABLED, AUTONOMOUS, TELEOP)
- Robot X
- Robot Y
- Robot Theta (deg)
